# Project Nemo: Nautilus Diving Club Management System

**Overview:**
Nautilus Diving Club, founded in 1988 by Mr. Georges NEMO, is a diving club offering recreational and professional diving services. The club needs a computerized management tool to manage its personnel, clients, diving equipment, and dive sessions. This system is built using C# and SQL Server 2008, with the server hosted externally, and TFS 2012 for team collaboration.

## Features:

- **Equipment Management:** Maintain an inventory of diving equipment available for rental.
- **Client Management:** Store details about club members and customers.
- **Dive Sessions:** Manage and record information about dives, participants, instructors, and equipment rentals.
- **Safety and Restrictions:** Enforce safety rules, including dive depth limits based on diver certification levels (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, Level 3/4).
- **Bookings and Rentals:** Track equipment rentals and participant bookings for each dive session.

## Technology Stack:
- **Backend:** C# and SQL Server 2008.
- **Version Control:** TFS 2012 (Team Foundation Server).
- **Database:** SQL Server for data management.

## Methodology:
- **Agile (SCRUM):** The project follows SCRUM methodology for collaborative and iterative development.

## Goals:
- Create a relational database to handle personnel, clients, and dive data.
- Develop an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
